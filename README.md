# Waggle-Power-BI-Report
A power BI project as part of Udacity Nanodegree program

In this project, I assumed to work as BI Analyst for Waggle, a startup company that focuses on making tracking devices for pets. Their products are called Lapdog and Lapcat. This project requires us to create a visualization from the business questions arised. The project results can be seen in image below with interactive content as per link on the bottom.
